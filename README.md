# AnnouncerPackInstaller

This is my League of Legends announcer pack installer. The whole idea of this is to make is easy to switch out between different custome announcer packs. Simply locate your League of Legends directory and your new announcer pack that you would like to install. Press the first button labeled "Find WPK". This will locate where your origonal announcer pack is located. You then have the option to backup the announcer pack that is currently your active one. If you choose to do this, it will automaticaly create a folder where your exe is located and place the announcer pack in that folder so you can easily go back to your origonal if you so desire. The second button labeled "Install WPK" will put the new announcer pack in the correct league folder. This was mostly made for coding practice but at the same time I would like to make something that is practical. Enjoy. Please report any bugs so I can fix them.
